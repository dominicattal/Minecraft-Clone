Minecraft Clone
Inspired from this repo: https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend

This is like my 3rd attempt at creating a Minecraft clone in OpenGL. My previous attempts used visual studio, C++, and a linear math library. However, I decided to use only C in vscode for this attempt. 

This project took about 11 days. The extent of my program is random world generation and flying  through the air. I learned a lot about graphics programming and C from this attempt, and I know I will do better on my next attempt.
